Over time, I found my place in creating websites and web applications, working both on the frontend and backend, most often using a combination of Vue and Laravel. The above-listed technologies and tools are those I work with most frequently, but they are not the only ones I have had the opportunity to learn throughout my programming history."

                "description": "DreamSpeak was my first major project, which allowed me to gain valuable experience with the Linux system and managing services such as hosting, VPS servers, and domains. As a result, my skills extend beyond just creating websites to include their proper deployment, selecting appropriate hosting providers, servers, and domain registrars. One of the outcomes of this project is the official DreamSpeak website, which serves as an information hub for all users of our services. I developed it as a business card, adding special modules such as DreamDesk, which allows users to contact administrators directly for various purposes and access documentation. The site also supported a forum for a long time, which was eventually closed. A key feature is the DreamEngine module, where I used a library that allows direct communication between the website and the TeamSpeak3 voice communicator. This makes it possible for users to manage their accounts from the browser without needing to be active on the communicator. At the time of creating this module, DreamSpeak was one of the few Polish TeamSpeak3 servers offering such functionality, providing a range of automations and improvements for users."

The goal of the project was to create an advertising management system that could be utilized by external companies. The system offers numerous functionalities related to managing user advertisements. Users can add new advertising campaigns, typically paying for the selected duration of the campaign. They can then track their advertisement statistics, which are recorded by the company using the system. A key element of the project was developing a robust administrative panel, integrated into the system. This allows administrators to access admin tabs where they can manage advertisements and users, as well as view an event log that records every action performed within the system. In this project, I served as the project leader. I was responsible for synchronizing the team's work, correctly merging and integrating updates, writing and refining code, and conducting code reviews. I also acted as a mentor, introducing other team members to Vue and Laravel, explaining the concepts of these frameworks in an understandable manner. This project allowed me to enhance my soft skills in collaborating with other developers."

Its primary function is to enable users to track the prices and availability of products from supported online stores. The application operates through web scraping: when a user adds a product to their list, Bargify attempts to match it with existing entries in the database to minimize redundant actions. If no match is found, the product is scraped from the online store. Subsequently, at regular intervals, the application updates product information. When a product meets the user's conditions, such as a maximum price, the user receives a web push notification. Users can easily add, edit, and delete products as well as manage notification settings, making Bargify a highly intuitive tool."

The project's goal was to develop an intuitive application that allows users to plan their workouts and track their progress. A crucial aspect of the project was designing and implementing a data structure that enables exercises added to the application to be shared among users. This way, every user can enrich the application's resources by adding their exercises to the public catalog or their private one. Users can create their own workout plans for specific days, track their progress in achieving maximum results, and use calculators to determine their caloric needs or BMI.

As a result, DreamFork contains many similarities to Laravel, allowing developers familiar with Laravel to quickly adapt to DreamFork. This framework is characterized by its small size and speed, making it ideal for developing simple web applications and APIs. Despite its compact size, DreamFork offers a range of essential features necessary for modern development. The framework is equipped with comprehensive documentation that details every aspect of its functionality, and its open-source code allows developers to customize the framework to their specific needs. DreamFork was also a key component of my engineering thesis, ensuring that its development was carefully supervised. Working on this project has allowed me to understand how to create comprehensive, scalable solutions that are easy to develop and maintain."

As the main and sole developer, I have been, and continue to be, responsible for the entire process of developing the portal, which includes writing code, ensuring its security, conducting appropriate tests, and deploying updates. I have made numerous improvements related to the portal's performance, optimizing both database structures and tables, as well as the portal's code, introducing many updates and optimizations. I have implemented many new features, such as Alert sections, web push notifications, account settings, and revamped sections like Discussions, Hotline, and many others. I have also enhanced the custom CMS panel created by the previous developer, adding a range of improvements and new functionalities. Additionally, I created a dedicated panel for advertisers, where company representatives can track the statistics of their ads, including the number of views and clicks during the campaign period. I was also responsible for creating the portal initially as a PWA application and later as a TWA application to make it available on the Google Play Store."
